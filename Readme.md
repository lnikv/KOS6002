![cmdstanpy install](cmdstanpy_install.png)

- The command `cmdstanpy.install_cmdstan(compiler=True)` downloads, and build up cmdstanpy as well as `Stan` system. In Windows 10/11, `RTools40` will be downloaded. It may take quite long (like 30 minutes) in some case.
- In MacOS, you must install `XCode` for various command line tools. `cmdstanpy.install_cmdstan(compiler=True)` will not install a compiler (`RTools40`) system. Instead, system compiler c++, clang++, etc will be used and they are installed when `XCode` is installed.
